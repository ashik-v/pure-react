Setup
- run npm install -g create-react-app
  - globally installs a command to install React apps
  - npm vs yarn (yarn may be a bit quicker)

Chapter 5
- think in componenets: think of the page, carve out components, name them, organize them in a heirarchial order, write the code
- for simple heirarchies, can follow top-down (parent then children) or bottom-up (children, then parent), but bottom-up seems to be better for more complex heirarchies as you can unit test, see them in isolation etc
  - converting a legacy app to React also prefers bottom-up
- className prop becomes the clas attribute on the DOM node
