 - Props are like HTML attributes or function arguments
 - Props allow you to pass data to components
 - JSX uses className instead of class to specify CSS classes
 - every componenent in JSX can be self closing
 - props are passed as an object
  - this means that you can either accept them and use dot notation or destructure them inside the argument list itself
 - props are only read-only and can only be passed down to children (react data flow is one-way)
